# CLAUDE.md — Project Instructions for Claude Code

## Project Overview

SFCW radar for within-wall imaging (rebar, pipes, voids, studs — not beyond the wall).
See CONTEXT.md for full system description.

## Key Facts

- This repo runs on TWO machines: Raspberry Pi (pi/) and PC (groundstation/)
- Clone the repo on both; run the appropriate code on each
- Pi never receives direct user input — all control via groundstation over LAN
- Heavy compute (SAR reconstruction, ML) belongs on the PC side
- Every subsystem must have a corresponding debug tool on groundstation

## Code Conventions

- Python for all Pi code (sensor drivers, radar control, networking)
- Python or TypeScript for groundstation (TBD based on UI framework choice)
- Shared protocol definitions in shared/protocols/
- Keep sensor interfaces minimal and async-friendly
- Prefer ZeroMQ or similar for IPC once protocol is chosen

## Hardware Context

- Raspberry Pi with AI HAT+ (Hailo-8L accelerator)
- Camera: Pi NoIR v3 (CSI, use libcamera/picamera2)
- LiDAR: TF-LC02 (UART, 115200 baud default)
- IMU: MPU-6500 (I2C, address 0x68)
- SDR: bladeRF (USB, use libbladeRF / pybladeRF)
- Antennas: 2x Vivaldi (wideband, one TX one RX)

## Living Documentation Rule

CLAUDE.md and CONTEXT.md are living documents. Whenever you learn key information
worth persisting — new design decisions, hardware findings, protocol choices,
calibration values, architectural changes, or anything a future session would
need to know — update CLAUDE.md and/or CONTEXT.md immediately. Don't wait to be
asked. These files are how context survives across sessions and collaborators.

## Current Phase

IMU, LiDAR, Camera, and bladeRF SDR integrated. All stream to groundstation debug panels.
RF Calib panel provides signal generator + oscilloscope for bladeRF calibration (TX1/RX1).
SFCW panel performs stepped-frequency sweeps (1–6 GHz default) with range profile + waterfall display.
Both RF panels share port 9003 — starting an SFCW sweep auto-stops any active TX/RX in RF Calib.

## SFCW Background Subtraction — Groundstation Only

All SFCW background subtraction happens on the groundstation. The Pi ships raw `h_cal`
and holds no background state; `sfcw_capture_bg`, `sfcw_clear_bg`, `sfcw_bg_mode`, and
`bscan_clear_bg` no longer exist as commands.

Two mutually exclusive sources, both in `App.jsx` `processedSfcwResult`:
- **Captured reference** — "Capture BG" tags the next sweep as `sfcwBgRef`.
- **ML model** — "Load Model" infers a background from lidar standoff (`bgModelInfer.js`).

Selecting either clears the other; "Clear BG" clears both. Subtraction is always complex
(vector) — the old complex/magnitude toggle is gone, complex was the default and is now
the only mode.

**Why groundstation-side:** Pi-side subtraction ran before transmission, so it silently
contaminated B-scan captures, SAR, and BG-model *training* data, which all read
`msg.h_cal_*`. Keeping the wire raw means only the SFCW live display is affected.

Note `SfcwDisplay` recomputes its own range profile from `h_cal_real/imag` for
windowing/range-comp, so any subtraction must write back into those fields — replacing
only `magnitudes`/`distances` gets silently discarded.
Pi-side architecture: bladerf_driver.py (HAL) → sfcw_engine.py (sweep logic) → sdr_server.py (WebSocket).
Next steps: OptiFlow pipeline, SAR reconstruction integration.

## BG Model — Capture Protocol and Findings

**Capture protocol (as of 2026-08-18).** One capture = N sweeps at a **static** standoff
(N configurable in the BG Model panel, default 40, persisted to `localStorage.bgmodel_sweeps`).
Positions are hand-placed and deliberately **irregular**; irregular beats uniform, because
uniform undersampling folds alias energy coherently onto a single wrong spatial frequency
while irregular spacing scatters it. Target: ~30 positions over the widest span the bench
allows (150 mm+).

`bgCaptureStats.computeCaptureStats()` runs at capture completion and stores, per position:
coherent complex mean (`h_mean_real/imag` — this is the training target), per-frequency noise
variance, per-sweep and post-averaging SNR, sweep-pair correlation, standoff mean/std, and
`radarRangeM` (range of the dominant return from the coherent mean, sub-bin interpolated).
`radarRangeM` is **diagnostic only** — nothing consumes it. It exists so the dataset carries an
independent standoff estimate to check the lidar against.

Training now uses **one sample per position** (the coherent mean), not every raw sweep. Replicas
measure the same standoff repeatedly, so feeding them individually adds no information — MSE
regresses to this mean anyway, at N× the epochs.

**Spacing limits** (`spacingLimits()`). An echo with path multiplier α oscillates in standoff
with period `c / (2·f·(α−1))`; worst case is α=3 (triple bounce) at the top of the band. At
5 GHz that period is 15 mm, so:
- ≤ 5 mm gaps — well sampled
- 5–7.5 mm — coarse but unaliased
- Above 7.5 mm — α=3 folds onto a wrong spatial frequency and *corrupts* a fit rather than missing detail

**Span sets echo resolution:** `Δα = c / (2·f_c·span)`. At 3.5 GHz, 85 mm span → Δα = 0.50;
150 mm → 0.29. Widest possible span is the single biggest accuracy lever.

**Export format v2** (`bgmodel_<N>pos_<ts>.json`): hoists `common` (num_steps, step_size,
range_offset) out of the per-sweep repetition and stores per-capture `stats` + column arrays
(`standoffs`, `real`, `imag`). ~7 MB for 30 positions × 40 sweeps. Import accepts v1 and v2 and
backfills stats when absent.

**Analysis of the existing MLP** (1 → 64 → 64 → 302 ReLU, 23,918 params, `bgmodel.worker.js`):
- Output is effectively **rank ~5** — SVD over the input domain puts 96% of energy in 5 PCs,
  in near-equal quadrature pairs (the signature of complex sinusoids in `d`). 19,328 of its
  parameters describe a rank-5 map.
- Only 13/64 first-layer knots land inside the input domain; 32/64 L1 and 17/64 L2 units are
  dead across the whole domain.
- Per-frequency residual magnitude spans **20 dB**, so pooled scalar target normalization makes
  MSE a silently power-weighted loss that starves the weak bins.
- `finalLoss` is training MSE with no held-out split anywhere. Param:data ratio was 0.32:1.
- Inference is 19.3 µs (~52k/s), ~1700× headroom at 30 fps. Sweeps run at 3–6 Hz, so the model
  is nowhere near the bottleneck — **data, not compute, is the constraint.**

**Lidar precision is the hard ceiling.** Two-way phase is `4πfd/c`, so at 5 GHz **1 mm of
standoff error = 12° of phase error**. 20 dB of coherent suppression needs the standoff to
~0.5 mm; the TF-LC02 is a ±few-mm sensor. Comparing `radarRangeM` against `standoffMm` across
the new dataset is the cheap test of whether a radar-derived standoff beats the lidar.

**Result on the 30-position bench set (2026-08-18) — the MLP was replaced.**
Leave-one-position-out suppression, `10*log10(signal/error)` on each held-out position's
measured spectrum, 30 positions over 155.8 mm, median gap 5.5 mm, 15 sweeps each:

| estimator | LOO suppression |
|---|---|
| **Akima interpolation, unwind α=0.80** (shipped) | **20.2 dB** (median 20.3, worst 4.0) |
| cubic spline, α=0.80 | 20.3 dB — best mean, but −12.3 dB on a bad knot |
| physics model, K=5 echoes, free A(f) | 18.7 dB |
| linear interpolation | 12.4 dB |
| Fourier-feature MLP (tanh, k=8..64) | 11.9 dB |
| nearest position | 7.4 dB |
| physics model, K=3, Chebyshev A(f) | 6.8 dB |
| **old 1-64-64-302 MLP** | **4.9 dB** |
| global mean | 0.9 dB |

The captures are dense relative to how fast the background varies, so interpolation wins
outright and needs no parameters. `bgModelInterp.js` ships Akima: it gives up 0.6 dB of mean
for a 16 dB better worst case, because it does not propagate a bad capture into neighbouring
intervals. Inference is 3.1 µs (320k/s, ~10,000× headroom at 30 fps); model file ~360 KB.
Models are `type: 'interp'`; `bgModelInfer.js` keeps the MLP path for previously saved files.

**Things that turned out differently than expected:**
- **The old MLP was underfitting, not overfitting.** 2000 full-batch epochs reached only
  7.97 dB in-sample; 10k → 12.0 dB, 40k → 13.3 dB. Its `finalLoss` looked small only because
  targets were normalized by a single pooled scalar. Its loss curve was still falling 7.4%
  per 100 epochs at epoch 1999. Verified by scoring the saved `models/model 3.json` weights
  directly: 8.6 dB in-sample, matching the numpy re-implementation used for the LOO sweep.
- **The unwind is better with α ≈ 0.80 than α = 1.0** (20.5 dB vs 19.1 dB), a broad plateau
  over 0.70–0.85. Unwinding removes fast phase but injects the lidar's own error into the
  target; 0.8 is the trade-off point. The α matched filter puts the wall echo at 0.93–0.95,
  consistent with the lidar over-reporting standoff *change* by 5–20%. Worth a calibration
  check, but not required — the interpolator absorbs it.
- **The `radarRangeM` diagnostic is unusable**: correlation 0.36 with lidar standoff, 39.9 mm
  scatter after a linear fit. Dominant-peak picking hops between echoes in the near field.
  Radar-derived standoff is not a usable input; the near-field skepticism was correct.
- **Echo structure is dominated by two components**: α≈0.0 (static cable/coupling reflection,
  strongest) and α≈0.93 (wall face, −3.4 dB). Everything else is ≥13 dB down. But a smooth
  (Chebyshev) `A_k(f)` caps the physics model at ~7 dB; with `A_k(f)` free per frequency it
  reaches 18.7 dB. The unmodelled echoes get absorbed into `A_k(f)` as fast frequency
  structure, so `A_k(f)` is *not* smooth.
- **A physics + spline hybrid gives exactly no gain** over the spline alone (20.60 vs 20.59 dB).
- **Measurement noise is not the limit.** The 15-sweep coherent mean sits 47.1 dB below signal.
  Position density is the limit.

**Position density is the dominant lever** (cleaned 22-position set, subsampled):

| median gap | LOO suppression |
|---|---|
| 5.9 mm | 19.3 dB |
| 11.8 mm | 6.9 dB |
| 17.7 mm | −3.3 dB |

Roughly 12 dB lost per doubling of gap. Capture as densely as patience allows; this matters
far more than any modelling choice.

**Range gating cannot separate in-wall targets from the wall face at this bandwidth.** The
entire background sits within 2–6 cm of range, and 3 GHz of bandwidth gives ~50 mm range
resolution. The "gated" metric therefore tracks the full-band metric closely. Separating a
target from the face needs more bandwidth or aperture, not better background subtraction.
